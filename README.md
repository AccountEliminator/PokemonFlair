# PokemonFlair

A reddit bot that does a few things for /r/pokemon.

* Set user flairs based on reddit PMs
* Removes posts with blacklisted domains
 
If you want to run your own version, run it once and it'll generate an empty config.json file for you to fill
with your configuration values. For reference, here's [/r/pokemon's config](https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/da9227ec6958ccad3475).
